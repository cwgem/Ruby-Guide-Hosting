      <h2>Description</h2>
      
<p>scanf for Ruby</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>scanf is an implementation of the C function scanf(3), modified as
necessary for ruby compatibility.</p>

<p>the methods provided are <a
href="../String.html#method-i-scanf">String#scanf</a>, <a
href="../IO.html#method-i-scanf">IO#scanf</a>, and <a
href="../Kernel.html#method-i-scanf">Kernel#scanf</a>. <a
href="../Kernel.html#method-i-scanf">Kernel#scanf</a> is a wrapper around
STDIN.scanf.  <a href="../IO.html#method-i-scanf">IO#scanf</a> can be used
on any <a href="../IO.html">IO</a> stream, including file handles and
sockets. scanf can be called either with or without a block.</p>

<p><a href="../Scanf.html">Scanf</a> scans an input string or stream according
to a <b>format</b>, as described below in Conversions, and returns an array
of matches between the format and the input.  The format is defined in a
string, and is similar (though not identical) to the formats used in
Kernel#printf and Kernel#sprintf.</p>

<p>The format may contain <b>conversion specifiers</b>, which tell scanf what
form (type) each particular matched substring should be converted to (e.g.,
decimal integer, floating point number, literal string, etc.)  The matches
and conversions take place from left to right, and the conversions
themselves are returned as an array.</p>

<p>The format string may also contain characters other than those in the
conversion specifiers.  White space (blanks, tabs, or newlines) in the
format string matches any amount of white space, including none, in the
input.  Everything else matches only itself.</p>

<p>Scanning stops, and scanf returns, when any input character fails to match
the specifications in the format string, or when input is exhausted, or
when everything in the format string has been matched. All matches found up
to the stopping point are returned in the return array (or yielded to the
block, if a block was given).</p>

<h2>Basic usage</h2>

<pre>require 'scanf'

# String#scanf and IO#scanf take a single argument, the format string
array = a_string.scanf(&quot;%d%s&quot;)
array = an_io.scanf(&quot;%d%s&quot;)

# Kernel#scanf reads from STDIN
array = scanf(&quot;%d%s&quot;)</pre>

<h2>Block usage</h2>

<p>When called with a block, scanf keeps scanning the input, cycling back to
the beginning of the format string, and yields a new array of conversions
to the block every time the format string is matched (including partial
matches, but not including complete failures).  The actual return value of
scanf when called with a block is an array containing the results of all
the executions of the block.</p>

<pre>str = &quot;123 abc 456 def 789 ghi&quot;
str.scanf(&quot;%d%s&quot;) { |num,str| [ num * 2, str.upcase ] }
# =&gt; [[246, &quot;ABC&quot;], [912, &quot;DEF&quot;], [1578, &quot;GHI&quot;]]</pre>

<h2>Conversions</h2>

<p>The single argument to scanf is a format string, which generally includes
one or more conversion specifiers.  Conversion specifiers begin with the
percent character (‘%’) and include information about what scanf should
next scan for (string, decimal number, single character, etc.).</p>

<p>There may be an optional maximum field width, expressed as a decimal
integer, between the % and the conversion.  If no width is given, a default
of `infinity’ is used (with the exception of the %c specifier; see below). 
Otherwise, given a field width of <em>n</em> for a given conversion, at
most <em>n</em> characters are scanned in processing that conversion. 
Before conversion begins, most conversions skip white space in the input
string; this white space is not counted against the field width.</p>

<p>The following conversions are available.</p>
<dl class="rdoc-list"><dt>%</dt>
<dd>
<p>Matches a literal `%‘. That is, `%%’ in the format string matches a single
input `%‘ character. No conversion is done, and the resulting ’%‘ is not
included in the return array.</p>
</dd><dt>d</dt>
<dd>
<p>Matches an optionally signed decimal integer.</p>
</dd><dt>u</dt>
<dd>
<p>Same as d.</p>
</dd><dt>i</dt>
<dd>
<p>Matches an optionally signed integer. The integer is read in base 16 if it
begins with `0x’ or `0X’, in base 8 if it begins with `0’, and in base 10
other- wise. Only characters that correspond to the base are recognized.</p>
</dd><dt>o</dt>
<dd>
<p>Matches an optionally signed octal integer.</p>
</dd><dt>x, X</dt>
<dd>
<p>Matches an optionally signed hexadecimal integer,</p>
</dd><dt>a, e, f, g, A, E, F, G</dt>
<dd>
<p>Matches an optionally signed floating-point number.</p>
</dd><dt>s</dt>
<dd>
<p>Matches a sequence of non-white-space character. The input string stops at
white space or at the maximum field width, whichever occurs first.</p>
</dd><dt>c</dt>
<dd>
<p>Matches a single character, or a sequence of <em>n</em> characters if a
field width of <em>n</em> is specified. The usual skip of leading white
space is suppressed. To skip white space first, use an explicit space in
the format.</p>
</dd><dt>[</dt>
<dd>
<p>Matches a nonempty sequence of characters from the specified set of
accepted characters.  The usual skip of leading white space is suppressed. 
This bracketed sub-expression is interpreted exactly like a character class
in a Ruby regular expression.  (In fact, it is placed as-is in a regular
expression.)  The matching against the input string ends with the
appearance of a character not in (or, with a circumflex, in) the set, or
when the field width runs out, whichever comes first.</p>
</dd></dl>

<h3>Assignment suppression</h3>

<p>To require that a particular match occur, but without including the result
in the return array, place the <b>assignment suppression flag</b>, which is
the star character (‘*’), immediately after the leading ‘%’ of a format
specifier (just before the field width, if any).</p>

<h2>scanf for Ruby compared with scanf in C</h2>

<p>scanf for Ruby is based on the C function scanf(3), but with modifications,
dictated mainly by the underlying differences between the languages.</p>

<h3>Unimplemented flags and specifiers</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>The only flag implemented in scanf for Ruby is ‘<tt>*</tt>’ (ignore
upcoming conversion).  Many of the flags available in C versions of
scanf(3) have to do with the type of upcoming pointer arguments, and are
meaningless in Ruby.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The <tt>n</tt> specifier (store number of characters consumed so far in
next pointer) is not implemented.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The <tt>p</tt> specifier (match a pointer value) is not implemented.</p>
</li></ul>

<h3>Altered specifiers</h3>
<dl class="rdoc-list"><dt>o, u, x, X</dt>
<dd>
<p>In scanf for Ruby, all of these specifiers scan for an optionally signed
integer, rather than for an unsigned integer like their C counterparts.</p>
</dd></dl>

<h3>Return values</h3>

<p>scanf for Ruby returns an array of successful conversions, whereas scanf(3)
returns the number of conversions successfully completed. (See below for
more details on scanf for Ruby’s return values.)</p>

<h2>Return values</h2>

<p>Without a block, scanf returns an array containing all the conversions it
has found.  If none are found, scanf will return an empty array. An
unsuccessful match is never ignored, but rather always signals the end of
the scanning operation.  If the first unsuccessful match takes place after
one or more successful matches have already taken place, the returned array
will contain the results of those successful matches.</p>

<p>With a block scanf returns a ‘map’-like array of transformations from the
block – that is, an array reflecting what the block did with each yielded
result from the iterative scanf operation.  (See “Block usage”, above.)</p>

<h2>Current limitations and bugs</h2>

<p>When using <a href="../IO.html#method-i-scanf">IO#scanf</a> under Windows,
make sure you open your files in binary mode:</p>

<pre>File.open(&quot;filename&quot;, &quot;rb&quot;)</pre>

<p>so that scanf can keep track of characters correctly.</p>

<p>Support for character classes is reasonably complete (since it essentially
piggy-backs on Ruby’s regular expression handling of character classes),
but users are advised that character class testing has not been exhaustive,
and that they should exercise some caution in using any of the more complex
and/or arcane character class idioms.</p>

<p>Thanks to Hal Fulton for hosting the Codefest.</p>

<p>Thanks to Matz for suggestions about the class design.</p>

<p>Thanks to Gavin Sinclair for some feedback on the documentation.</p>

Conversions sections, above, were adapted from the Linux Programmer’s
Manual manpage for scanf(3), dated 1995-11-01.</p>

<h2>Bugs and bug reports</h2>

<p>scanf for Ruby is based on something of an amalgam of C scanf
implementations and documentation, rather than on a single canonical
description.  Suggestions for features and behaviors which appear in other
scanfs, and would be meaningful in Ruby, are welcome, as are reports of
suspicious behaviors and/or bugs.  (Please see “Credits and
acknowledgements”, above, for email addresses.)</p>
