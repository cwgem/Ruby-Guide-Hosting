<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
This is a listing of the documentation for Ruby 1.9.3 preview 1. It's meant to be more up to date than what I've seen on the official ruby docs site. This currently runs on a free Heroku instance so the stability may vary. 
</p>

<h2>Layout</h2>

<p>
The documentation is organized as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="core/index.html">Core Documentation</a> - This is darkfish (rdoc) documentation for the core c based classes of Ruby.</li>
<li><a href="ext/index.html">C Extensions Documentation</a> - This is darkfish (rdoc) documentation for the c based Ruby extensions. These were broken out so as to prevent confusion for implementations that do not support c extensions.</li>
<li><a href="darkfish_stdlib/index.html">Standard Library Darkfish Docmentation (rdoc)</a> - This is darkfish (rdoc) documentation for the Ruby based standard library.</li>
<li><a href="yard_stdlib/index.html">Standard Library Yard Docmentation</a> - This is yard (yardoc) documentation for the Ruby based standard library.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Translations</h2>

<p>Here are some translations done of Japanese articles about Ruby:</p>
